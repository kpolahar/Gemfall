# About Gemfall

This project's purpose is to serve as a sample of my work creating html banner ads
which are animated using javascript, because most of my prior experience creating
these ads was done in my previous job, and I am unable to share the work I did
while I was there as proof that I can, in fact, create animated banner ads.

I chose to create a banner ad for Steven Universe, because it is one of my favorite
tv shows, and its creators are known for being very supportive of their fandom and
I think if they saw my ad, they'd enjoy it, and view it as fan art, as I do.

All of the svg artwork featured in the banner with the exception of the Steven Universe
logo was created by me using Adobe Illustrator.

The animation is done using Javascript using the TweenMax and TimelineLite libraries.
The timing took a while to get right, but I find it very satisfying to watch.
